Ex-scenester MySpace celebrity and Warped Tour musical artist, Jeffree Star (legally Jeffrey Lynn Steininger) launched his cosmetic line in 2014 with a steady increase in social media fame &mdash; his YouTube subscriber count is currently at currently 11 million. His binary-breaking androgynous looks, DGAF attitude, massive wealth, and public confidence in his sexuality are all something many people (often young, white, and queer) look up to. While his mainstream popularity is more recent, his use of violent language toward PoC, WoC, and women et all dates back to the mid-2000s.

During a comedy sketch with a friend in the MySpace era (pre-2010), Star used disgusting, violent, anti-black language in AAVE for the sake of “edgy humor”.

In various short videos from the same time period, he uses horrifyingly similar, violent language, without the guise of “comedy”.

A few weeks after these old videos resurfaced, he gave a half-hearted “I’m a human being and I fucked up” [apology](http://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/jeffree-star-racist-video/3778/jeffree-to-his-credit-did-apologize-for-this-video-which-he-says-was-a-huge-mistake/5) in summer 2016.

…*without* denouncing his racist views. As more old, problematic content popped up ([like him going out on Halloween with a friend in blackface](http://jeffreestar.tumblr.com/post/12112029370/spice-world-happy-halloween-spice-girls-for)), he continued to brush it off with apologies on social media saying it was all for shock value.

[A very public falling out](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/07/117317/jeffree-star-kat-von-d-fight) occurred between Star and his longtime ex-friend and professional collaborator, fellow problematic beauty icon Kat Von D. Kat’s post specifically denounced Star's racism.

In March 2017, Jeffree Star Cosmetics [significantly deepened a model’s complexion](https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/news/a45491/jeffree-star-blackface-controvercy/) for a product photoshoot. When Star received criticism for using blackface to sell a product, he defended the "creative choices" of the shoot. Even when choosing a trans woman of color as a model, Star's actions were undeniably anti-black.

That June, he called successful black beauty YouTuber Jackie Aina (2m+ subscribers) an “[irrelevant rat](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/jeffree-star-jackie-aina/8146/when-the-tweet-was-brought-to-stars-attention-he-responded-with-several-tweets-suggesting-aina-used-his-name-for-views/2)” after she said [she wouldn’t purchase his products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77MATdJ9ndw) because of his anti-black past.

Using hateful language specifically toward prominent black women beauty YouTubers was not new for Star.

3 days after the tweets about Jackie Aina, Jeffree Star finally released an [apology video](https://donotlink.it/vllQ) [explaining away](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/jeffree-star-racism-apology/8164/star-says-the-racist-remarks-he-made-in-the-videos-were-the-result-of-depression-and-bullying--and-that-his-response-was-not-acceptable/5) his old, admittedly bad behavior with his own fight with depression, bullying, and anger &mdash; that the racial hatred wasn’t about race at all.

The following summer, [Shane Dawson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV9_KinVpV-snHe3C3n1hvA), one of the most popular accounts on YouTube with 18m subscribers, released a multi-part [docuseries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUf2-sjGqQw) on Star. The series attempt to lift the veil and provide a new perspective to all the controversy, though Star is only portrayed in a positive light. It kicked off [dramageddon](https://stayhipp.com/news/beauty-vlogger-dramageddon-everything-online-is-permanent/), which led more beauty YouTubers to [confirm and denounce](https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/makeup-skincare/a23549739/jackie-aina-jeffree-star-feud/) [Star’s current racism](https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/a23781141/jeffree-star-thomas-halbert-feud/).

He styled his hair in [cornrows and box braids](https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/hair/a23509827/jeffree-star-cornrows/), classically Black styles, to promote his own brand for a holiday 2018 campaign.

It never ends.
