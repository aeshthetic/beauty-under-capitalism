Lorenzo Delpani served as CEO of drugstore mega-brand Revlon from November 2013 to February 2016. In January 2015, a former top scientist [sued the company](https://www.scribd.com/document/251874636/Complaint-Meyers-v-Revlon) after his dismissal. Delpani’s disgusting comments were [noted in the suit](https://nypost.com/2015/01/01/revlon-ceo-rips-blacks-jews-us-bias-suit/), claiming “Jews stick together,” that he “could smell a black person when he entered a room,” and that Americans (Delpani is Italian-born) were “small-minded” and “dirty.” The case was “amicably resolved” in March 2015. Delpani denied any allegations and continued to serve as CEO for another 11 months, winning [industry marketing awards](https://wwd.com/business-news/marketing-promotion/beauty-inc-awards-marketer-jill-scalamandre-lorenzo-delpani-10293350/).
