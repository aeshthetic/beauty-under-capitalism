Madam C.J. Walker’s eponymous haircare brand has an incredibly history. The [first American self-made female millionaire](http://mentalfloss.com/article/518125/retrobituaries-madam-cj-walker-first-self-made-female-millionaire-us) was born in the late 1800s to slaves in Louisiana. She was orphaned and widowed before building a new life for herself and her daughter. Walker started her own company formulating and selling hair products, building a factory, salon, and school to support her business. By her death in 1919, 40k black women had been trained as Walker saleswomen.

The brand remained stagnant in family control throughout the mid-1900s, was sold in 1985, and then publicly revived in 2016 by [the same parent company](https://www.sundialbrands.com/our-brands/) that [reformulated Shea Moisture products](#shea-moisture) to serve a “wider audience.” Products and messaging that were once expressly for black women, by black women, have now been [reformulated](https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2016/03/04/sephora-intro-madam-c-j-walker-female-milliionaire.html) for “[all backgrounds and textures of hair](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2016/10/02/legacy-reborn-madam-cj-walker-hair-products-back/91433826/#).”
