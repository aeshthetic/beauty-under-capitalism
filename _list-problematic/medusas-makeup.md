Medusa’s Makeup is a white supremacist vegan + cruelty-free cosmetics company and subscription box from Chicago with 50k+ followers on Instagram. (If you’re looking for vegan boxes from owners who aren’t nazis, try [these](https://www.petitvour.com/) [two](https://nourishbeautybox.com/)!)

The official brand website does not include any mention of the owners. To prove these are the two owners of the brand, you can [search the Illinois LLC lookup](https://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController) and see [Novikov’s LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pier-novikov-see-chasteen-a5a0ab11).

They started the company [in 2006](https://daneesunshynemakeup.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/medusas-makeup/), but they’ve been in business together since at least 1998 according to [old interviews](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/active-cultures-whipping-up-the-electroclash-scene/Content?oid=911897).

They try to keep their past hidden, but word quietly gets around on social media via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155240792872664&id=143185447663) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/67vu83/tati_takes_a_stand_against_too_faced/dgubg08/), with no public acknowledgement from the company whatsoever.

Novikov’s views are made clear in the Chicago music scene and have spread to [Washington state](https://www.facebook.com/SpokaneDSA/posts/statement-on-white-supremacist-pier-novikov-and-spokane-dsas-rejection-of-fascis/2162470277364996/). Pier Novikov, also known as Pier Zambrano or his DJ moniker Subtropical, appeared in the [anti-racist action Chicago antifa blog](http://southsideantifa.blogspot.com/2015/10/meet-white-supremacist-dj-pier-zambrano.html). The post details, with photos, his sketchy white supremacist tattoos, known associates, and antisemitic and racist public postings.
