Medusa’s Makeup is a white supremacist vegan + cruelty-free cosmetics company and subscription box from Chicago with 50k+ followers on Instagram.

The official brand website does not include any mention of the owners. To prove these are the two owners of the brand, you can [search the Illinois LLC lookup](https://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController) and see [Novikov’s LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pier-novikov-see-chasteen-a5a0ab11).

They started the company [in 2006](https://daneesunshynemakeup.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/medusas-makeup/), but they’ve been in business together since at least 1998 according to [old interviews](https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/active-cultures-whipping-up-the-electroclash-scene/Content?oid=911897) from [major Chicago publications](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-02-02-9802020096-story.html).

They try to keep their past hidden, but word quietly gets around on social media via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155240792872664&id=143185447663) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/67vu83/tati_takes_a_stand_against_too_faced/dgubg08/), with no public acknowledgement from the company whatsoever.

Novikov’s views are made clear in the Chicago music scene and have spread to [Washington state](https://www.facebook.com/SpokaneDSA/posts/statement-on-white-supremacist-pier-novikov-and-spokane-dsas-rejection-of-fascis/2162470277364996/). Pier Novikov, also known as Pier Zambrano or his DJ moniker Subtropical, appeared in the [anti-racist action Chicago antifa blog](http://southsideantifa.blogspot.com/2015/10/meet-white-supremacist-dj-pier-zambrano.html). The post details, with photos, his sketchy white supremacist tattoos, known associates, and antisemitic and racist social media postings.

While the publicly available information about Novikov’s hatred is only limited to that post, the information contained in it and the lack of any statement from Medusa’s Makeup denouncing those views are enough reasons to shun the brand.
