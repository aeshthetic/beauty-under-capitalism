Kat Von D (legally Katherine von Drachenberg) is a white Latina tattoo artist, TV personality, and entrepreneur who rose to massive public popularity in the mid-2000s, with her own TV show premiering in 2007. Her cosmetics line, a Kendo brand exclusive to Sephora, launched the following year.

The earliest known example linking Kat Von D to antisemitism was found in 2008: an [autographed photo](http://www.tmz.com/2008/02/08/kat-von-d-anti-semite/) with nazi wording and iconography that she claims she didn’t sign.

While a woman should not be judged solely for her partner’s actions, in 2010 Kat was engaged a to a polarizing TV personality and gun manufacturer who collects Nazi memorabilia, [loves Trump](https://jezebel.com/trump-supporter-jesse-james-a-real-catch-calls-cheati-1793272829), and [whose ex-wife claims he turned into a different person](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/sandra-bullock-reacts-estranged-husband-jesse-james-nazi-photo-not-man-married-article-1.163408). Kat never publicly called out his antisemitic behavior.

In 2013 and 2015, her cosmetics line drew attention for inappropriately named lipsticks: “Celebutard” and “Underage Red”. Kat [pulled “Celebutard”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/celebutard-lipstick-sephora_n_4233966.html) at Sephora’s behest and [defended “Underage Red”](https://www.facebook.com/katvond/photos/a.10150126087930454/10155445585345454/?type=1&theater).

Kat is a textbook white feminist who chooses which causes she believes in as she has proven herself an ally in some respects. She [denounced Jeffree Star](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/07/117317/jeffree-star-kat-von-d-fight) after excusing him for too long and [uninvited a contest winner](https://www.allure.com/story/makeup-artist-disqualified-kat-von-d-contest-trump) to represent her brand once after finding out they were a Trump supporter in 2017.

Her accountability seems to be very shallow, focused on [lifting white women](https://strivingwithsystems.com/2016/12/29/kat-von-d-illustrates-the-dangers-of-neoliberal-whiteness-in-veganism/) instead of fighting societal norms against people of color.

A very outspoken vegan, Kat’s views against animal cruelty are part of her and her brand’s identities. In June 2018, [she announced](https://www.racked.com/2018/6/11/17448758/kat-von-d-antivaxxer-instagram-vegan) she plans to raise her baby vegan and will not vaccinate her child.

September 2018 brought a disturbing social media post from the Kat Von D Beauty account, where a seemingly brown-skinned hand posed with a KVD concealer in front of a cotton field with a caption about “hard work” and the 💪🏽 medium-dark skin-tone muscle emoji. The insensitivity is staggering.
