Until a rebrand in 2018, drugstore mainstay brand Almay had *never* had face product shades deeper than than, and thus never advertised for women of color. In 2016, with their history of ignoring any non-white skin tone, they referred to their [“American look” white models as “Simply American](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/american-white).” When asked about this, [Almay responded](https://www.facebook.com/Upworthy/posts/10152557868457120) saying the white models were an expression of the “pure beauty” in every woman.
