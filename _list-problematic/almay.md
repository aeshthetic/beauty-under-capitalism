Until a rebrand in 2018, drugstore mainstay brand Almay *never* had face product shades deeper than tan and thus never advertised to women of color. In 2016, with their history of ignoring non-white skin tones, Almay referred to their [“American look” white models as “Simply American](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/american-white).” When questioned, [Almay responded](https://www.facebook.com/Upworthy/posts/10152557868457120) that the white models were an expression of the “pure beauty” in every woman.
