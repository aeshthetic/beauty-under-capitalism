In August 2018, popular prestige skin-focused cosmetics brand BECCA released a [promotional photo of their newest foundation](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/becca-cosmetics-accused-blackface-foundation-swatch-images). It was immediately clear to their audience that the image was digitally edited. At least 2 of the arms were altered to look darker, apparent by the uniform coloring of the palms. Not only is it dishonest to fake product colors, but this act was essentially digital blackface. Two days later, they re-shot the image using 4 different people in an [apology post](https://hypebae.com/2018/8/becca-cosmetics-response-skin-love-campaign-photoshop-controversy).
