Super popular budget brand Colourpop is known for a non-stop release cycle. In 2016, they launched highlight and contour sticks in a decent shade range, but the lightest shades got names like “Gummy Bear” and “Castle” while the deepest shades were [“Yikes” and “Typo”](http://affinitymagazine.us/2016/09/19/dear-colour-pop-my-skin-color-is-not-a-typo/). They [quickly renamed the shades](https://twitter.com/Moyooxo/status/778676500308500480) after the public calling out, but never issued a statement.

Latina beauty YouTuber Kathleen Lights was caught [saying the n-word](https://www.bustle.com/p/that-viral-video-of-a-beauty-blogger-using-the-n-word-is-so-much-more-effed-up-than-you-think-81105) in September 2017 and her collaboration line with Colourpop was publicly released that December. However, an earlier collaboration between the two was [supposed to launch in October](https://www.revelist.com/makeup/colourpop-kathleen-lights-palette/12441/more-fans-began-to-peel-the-stickers-of-their-palettes-back-to-confirm-you-had-me-at-hello-was-supposed-to-be-lumina-by-kathleen-lights-heres-a-closeup-of-another-fans-peeled-palette/4), but Colourpop covered it up (literally, with stickers) and released the items as a standalone product (potentially to avoid immediate blowback).
