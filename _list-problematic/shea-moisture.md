Shea Moisture was founded in 1991, inspired by founder's grandmother, a woman in Sierra Leone who started selling beauty products in the early 1900s. Since its founding, the brand was a hair and skin staple for black women with kinky and coily hair.

After selling the company to an investment firm co-founded by Mitt Romney, it began a slow and [steady stream of re-formulating](http://www.curlynikki.com/2015/11/did-sheamoisture-change-their-formula.html) and [advertising to white white women and light-skinned WoC](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-shea-moisture-commercial-forgot-about-women-of-color) instead of the black women who made the brand as successful as it was.
