In July 2018, a [black k-beauty YouTuber](https://twitter.com/MissDarcei/status/1019703054042464256) reported a “blackface manicure” by one of Korea’s most popular and affordable cosmetic companies, 3CE. 3CE is the beauty brand of Stylenanda, a major Asian fast fashion retailer founded by Korean woman entrepreneur [Kim So Hee](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/how-koreas-stylenanda-became-a-fashion-force-1202664216/).

Two months after Stylenanda et all was acquired by L'Oréal, the promotional image was found via Instagram Sponsored stories. The post features the same hand displayed twice, one unsuccessfully altered darker as retouchers uniformly darkened the palms.
