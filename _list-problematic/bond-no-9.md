New York luxury fragrance brand Bond No. 9’s French-Lebanese founder and president, Laurice Rahmé, was [sued by two former employees](

Rahmé is alleged to have called Black people “thieves” and alerted security with a code word when dark-skinned customers came into the store. The Latina former employee said she was not allowed to serve white customers because of her complexion. When the two women brought up the racism to Rahmé, Rahmé fired them and accused them of stealing. The suit was eventually dropped.
