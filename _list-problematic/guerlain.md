The fourth-generation owner and master perfumer of French fragrance, cosmetics, and skincare house Guerlain was [fined in 2012](http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/world/europe/france-guerlain-racism-ruling/index.html) for a horribly racist statement on TV that the court deemed “dated and disagreeable.” Guerlain sold the family company to LVMH 16 years prior and left the company around the time of the remarks.
