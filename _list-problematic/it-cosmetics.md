IT Cosmetics is a beauty brand known for its skincare-ingredient-infused face makeup. The brand was [sold to L'Oréal in 2016 for $1.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2017/05/17/jamie-kern-lima-loreal-beauty-it-cosmetics/#d9c45a33b4f9). Jamie Kerns Lima, a white woman, is the company’s founder and CEO &mdash; the only woman CEO out of any L'Oréal brand in its 100+ year history.

At a September 2017 beauty industry award ceremony for women executives, Lima waxed lyrical about the need for diverse representation in the beauty industry. The inspirational [speech went viral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqRw-JSYADc) as Lima talked about her brand’s success coming from representing “women of all shapes, sizes, skin tones, and skin issues.” However, IT Cosmetics is known in the space for having a [pitiful shade range for people of color](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-founder-of-it-cosmetics-made-a-viral-speech-on-inclusivity-women-of-color-arent-having-it-2414205) (the darkest shade in the image below was released earlier that year, well after the initial six shades).
