Black Opal is a black-owned brand launched in 1994 for women of color. All of a sudden, in 2015, they began to [claim the brand is not really for black women](http://clutchmagonline.com/2015/10/please-dont-associate-black-opal-cosmetics-with-black-women/). [This amazing reporting by Blaq Vixen Beauty](http://www.blaqvixenbeauty.com/black-beauty-brands-non-black-ceos/) shows there has always been sketchiness regarding who is credited as founding the company.
