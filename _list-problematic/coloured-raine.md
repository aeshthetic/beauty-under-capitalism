Coloured Raine is a company that claims to “encourage self expression and diversity,” owned by black woman founder and CEO [Loraine R. Dowdy](https://colouredraine.com/pages/our-story). In July 2016, Dowdy [doubled down](https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/will-you-be-buying-from-coloured-raine.1053414/) on “all lives matter” rhetoric on Instagram because of discriminatory treatment of her non-black husband and mixed-race son.

There is an issue with colorism and skin tone representation across their lipstick product photos (gifs below to demonstrate).

Color swatches are shown via custom photography on lighter skinned women.

But representations on darker skinned women are just the same image, Photoshopped per color.
