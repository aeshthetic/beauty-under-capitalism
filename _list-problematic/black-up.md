It appears as though the black founder of the brand [was pushed out by a white man](https://www.lipstickalley.com/threads/how-black-up-cosmetics-was-stolen-from-black-founder-bernard-fabrice-mahabo.945223/) starting in 2010. When questioned, Sephora deleted customer Facebook comments instead of addressing the claims. [Investigate write-ups](https://www.blaqvixenbeauty.com/black-up-lost-founder-fabrice-mahabo/#.VjI-tPmrTIU) detail [the secretive erasure](https://madamenoire.com/584883/blackup-cosmetics-mystery-company-still-black-owned-not/).
