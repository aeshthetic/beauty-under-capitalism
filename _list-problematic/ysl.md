The cosmetics branch of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent is owned by L'Oréal. In 2017, they claimed to have released shades for “all skin tones” with 22 shades “from light to dark” — that were [actually 21 variations of beige](https://lisaalamode.com/2017/08/03/black-women-dragging-ysl-beauty-hell-back-newest-product-launch/) and one deep shade.

A few months later, they [tried to learn from their mistake](https://www.bet.com/style/beauty/2018/01/06/ysl-campaign.html) by including a dark-skinned arm in their new concealer swatches, even though the limited range of shades contained no color close to matching the model’s skin tone.
