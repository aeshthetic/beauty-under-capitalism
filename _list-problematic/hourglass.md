Hourglass Cosmetics is a vegan luxury brand founded by CEO Carisa Janes in 2004. In 2015, three women of color ex-employees in London [sued Hourglass](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/cosmetics-boss-called-me-coloured-lady-says-ex-worker-at-liberty-suing-for-racism-a2944511.html) for £38k for instances of [racial, gender, and religious discrimination](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3229429/Mixed-race-beauty-worker-s-boss-demanded-look-Western.html). They alleged they were told to “look more Western”, heard insensitive language from CEO Janes, could only publish articles under pen names when white employees could use their legal names, and that they were wrongfully dismissed. Janes denied all allegations and [Hourglass won the suit](https://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/Hourglass_Cosmetics_faces_discrimination_allegations/112157).
