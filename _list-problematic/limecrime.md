([This 2015 deep dive](https://www.vox.com/2015/9/28/9392021/lime-crime-doe-deere-hated-xenia-vorotova) from one of my absolute favorite beauty writers covers the whole saga better than I can!)

Doe Deere (legally Xenia Vorotova) grew to massive cult popularity on LiveJournal in the mid-2000s, sewing and selling vintage and Japanese-street-fashion-inspired clothing, and continually reinventing her image. During this time, there was [some controversy](https://www.sutori.com/story/limecrimescandal-part-one) over [her actions](https://ohdeardoedeere.tumblr.com/post/75607412764/history-page-w-most-of-the-working-links) involving copying other’s original ideas and reselling items at inflated prices. In October 2008, she launched Lime Crime Make Up with her co-founder husband, Mark Dumbelton.

Deere, Russian Jewish by descent, dressed up as Adolf Hitler for “[typical bad taste](https://web.archive.org/web/20090521195657/http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/halloween-throughout-the-years)” shock factor on Halloween, exactly one year before Lime Crime launches as a makeup brand. Not until 2015 did she apologize for her “[extremely poor taste](https://web.archive.org/web/20150910145155/http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/doedeeredressedashitler/)” which she reiterated in 2018 as a “[coping mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-so-3lfLzr4).”

Customers who purchased from Lime Crime Makeup and Deere’s prior fashion endeavors reported [shockingly poor customer service](http://lillianfunnyface.blogspot.com/2009/10/lime-crime-makeup-dilemma.html) and seriously inappropriate letters.

[This November 2009 LiveJournal post](https://emeraldsrain.livejournal.com/149717.html) rounds up and reposts several different sources of negative product reviews, negative experiences, Internet-sleuthing of Deere's “mean girl” behavior, and cease-and-desists being sent to critical reviewers.

The [most prolific beauty blogger in the late 2000s](https://www.temptalia.com/temptalia-mentioned-by-wwd-as-one-of-the-hottest-beauty-blogs/) gave a middling-to-negative [review](https://www.temptalia.com/lime-crime-lipsticks-reviews-photos-swatches/) of Lime Crime products. Deere retaliated by emailing Lime Crime customers to [request](https://www.racked.com/2015/9/28/9392021/lime-crime-doe-deere-hated-xenia-vorotova) they send emails to the bloggers’s personal address, singing the praises of Lime Crime makeup.

In 2012, Lime Crime released the China Doll eyeshadow palette. Regardless of previous drama, there were [incredibly valid critiques](http://www.portraitofmai.com/2012/01/lime-crime-youre-doing-it-wrong.html) of the palette’s concept, naming, and promotional photos being cultural appropriative. Deere personally [responded to the criticisms](https://web.archive.org/web/20150317010038/http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/chinadoll-lives-on/) by saying the idea of getting upset over cultural appropriation is “kind of silly” in her non-apology.

Lime Crime touted itself as a vegan and cruelty-free company [as early as 2010](http://web.archive.org/web/20100227211141/http:/www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/lime-crime-makeup-certified-cruelty-free-donates-to-bideawee#comments) even though they continually used [animal products](https://ohdeardoedeere.tumblr.com/post/72284853606/i-hope-everyone-had-a-wonderful-and-enjoyable) [as ingredients](http://veganmakeup.tumblr.com/post/81474519086/how-cruelty-free-are-lime-crime-really).

In May 2014, legally one-upping her previous cease-and-desists, Deere [sued a critical blogger for $250,000 in lost sales](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/3675926/Lime_Crime_et_al_v_Jascynski).

In February 2015, Lime Crime [announced a security breach](https://jezebel.com/lime-crimes-website-is-hacked-customer-information-sto-1686744501) from the previous year. The site’s SSL certificate was outdated by six months and hackers were able to steal months of sensitive customer information. Lime Crime discovered the breach in October 2014. They chose to inappropriately convey this serious announcement via Instagram, while [some customers](https://hellorousseau.com/2015/08/25/pandoras-purple-box-part-2/) grappled with the severity of spending $20 on lipstick and [having their credit scores ruined](https://dailygeekette.wordpress.com/2015/03/21/lime-crime-stole-my-identity/). A [class action law suit was settled](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/lime-crime-lawsuit-settlement/10909) two years later.

After years of [customer complaints regarding safety](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/08/93130/lime-crime-lipsticks-illegal-additives-fda-approval#.xgjftv:zHfu), the FDA sent Lime Crime a [warning letter in July 2015](https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2015/ucm456525.htm) regarding unsafe ingredients in their lip products. When customers demanded answers to questions about the ingredients, they found their profiles [blocked by the company account](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/37158s/has_anyone_contacted_lime_crime_re_cashmeres_use/).

Formulation issues had not ended by 2016. The combination of the ingredients, packaging, and instructions in their Superfoil eyeshadows led to [rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ_Ml2MBqho) and [mold](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/55qyc9/psa_lime_crime_superfoils_may_have_mold/).

Even in 2017, there was [controversy over repackaging](https://ohdeardoedeere.tumblr.com/post/161521856859/brushes-what-brushes) cheap Chinese products for much higher costs and extremely [poor taste social media posts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXyddaTvgFY).

Deere stepped down from her CEO role in 2017 as long-time consultant Kim Walls [stepped in as Global Brand Manager](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/beauty-companies-seeking-investors-10907240/). Walls’ [open conversations](https://www.racked.com/2018/3/6/17081186/lime-crime-comeback-controversy-new-stores-ulta) regarding the company’s past aided Lime Crime in becoming a more mainstream beauty brand sold at popular retailers like Urban Outfitters, Revolve, Bloomingdale’s, and Ulta.

The company was [sold to new owners](https://www.racked.com/2018/6/18/17474588/lime-crime-doe-deere-sold-tengram-private-equity) in 2018 and has a [new CEO committed to keeping positive momentum going, while not ignoring the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snPmdLtwlb4). Deere is no longer involved with day-to-day operations or majority ownership, but she and her co-founder husband [still sit on the board of directors](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lime-crime-founder-doe-deere-reassures-fans-speaks-out-on-decision-to-sell-company-her-new-role-and-exciting-future-plans-300683887.html).
