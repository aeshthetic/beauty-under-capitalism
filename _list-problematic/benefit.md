Benefit Cosmetics, owned by powerhouse conglomerate LVMH, is a popular prestige beauty brand sold worldwide. In summer 2017, Benefit [collaborated with five major beauty YouTubers](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/benefit-beauty-stowaways/8791). To consumers’ disappointment, Benefit re-released mini sizes five of their staple products and featured one YouTuber each on new limited packaging. Benefit’s complexion products historically excluded darker shades, so it was not a surprise when the five influencers chosen were white or Latina — and that one of them is a problematic figure himself.
