 Kylie Jenner is a TV personality, model, and entrepreneur who made her fortune [appropriating black culture](https://nylon.com/articles/kylie-jenner-forbes-cultural-appropriation-black-culture) alongside [her family](https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a27683/kardashian-enterprises-cultural-appropriation/). She launched her beauty line, Kylie Cosmetics, in 2015. The brand initially focused on lip products, a logical marketing decision as Kylie rose to mainstream fame the year prior [thanks to her augmented pout](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3070852/Kylie-Jenner-17-FINALLY-admits-lip-fillers-big-sister-Khloe-Kardashian-urges-stop-lying.html).

In late 2016, Kylie Cosmetics released a promotional photo bearing a striking resemblance to an earlier [artistic image by makeup artist @vladamua](https://www.instagram.com/p/BNBK41BDyk_/?utm_source=ig_embed). To some, Kylie Cosmetics’ and Vlada’s styles were so intertwined that an image actually made by Vlada was [assumed to be a new Kylie promo photo](https://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/this-makeup-artist-is-accusing-kylie-jenner-of-stealing-her). The artist [sued Kylie, Inc.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/news/a20109/kylie-jenner-makeup-lawsuit/) and the case was settled.

Apart from this copyright claim, a clothing line Jenner owns with her sister was also [hit with a lawsuit](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-july-kendall-kylie-jenner-lawsuit-1499707015-htmlstory.html) for commercial use of unlicensed photographs.

Topshop introduced Kylie Cosmetics pop-up shops in their stores for the fall/winter 2017 season, and consumers found [unsightly, unsanitary conditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjdQBk4EoaM) for the online-only retailer.

December 2017 also brought Kylie, Inc. a [lawsuit for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.lofficielusa.com/beauty/kylie-jenner-s-company-is-being-sued-for-being-inaccessible-to-the-blind) — a legal requirement to meet minimum standards for website accessibility.

Kylie Cosmetics released 30 concealer shades in January 2018, featuring 25 shades of fair to medium-tan with peach, pink, and yellow undertones, [leaving all the deepest shades to have red undertones](https://www.revelist.com/makeup/kylie-jenner-concealer-dark/11133/they-want-her-to-know-cherry-red-is-fine-but-our-complexions-have-a-lot-more-range-than-that/4). Skin of all shades also pulls all undertones; a common [art and beauty misconception](https://notebook.hongkonggong.com/2018/01/16/inclusive-illustration-research-part-2/) is to only use a red undertone for deep skin. Even the shades with descriptions reading “yellow” and “golden” pulled [much more peachy-pink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ_ODhhQmxk) when actually swatched.

Jenner’s lip and cheek “nude” shades [ignoring darker skin entirely](https://www.revelist.com/makeup/kylie-jenner-nude/10556), [stealing from indie WoC designers](https://www.refinery29.com/2017/06/158378/kylie-jenner-stolen-camo-clothing-designs), paired with [the massive success of Fenty’s inclusive range of face makeup](https://www.revelist.com/beauty-news-/kylie-jenner-fenty-beauty/10761) just a few months prior to the concealer launch, left many black beauty consumers feeling pandered to.
