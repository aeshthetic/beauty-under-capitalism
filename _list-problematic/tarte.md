Tarte is a cruelty-free makeup and skincare company founded by Maureen Kelly, a white woman who dropped out of her Ph.D program at Columbia to start her cosmetics empire.

On MLK Day 2018, Tarte released a limited foundation range where only two shades suited dark skin tones, [in stark contrast to 12 beige shades](https://www.thisisinsider.com/tarte-cosmetics-shape-tape-foundation-range-2018-1). This foundation was a follow-up product to their iconic Shape Tape concealer (one is sold
every 26 seconds), which also has very few options for deep complexions. Tarte apologized and eventually expanded the range, but not before [consumer trust was eroded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cXsgT3ZcL8x).
