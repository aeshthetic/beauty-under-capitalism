Ben Nye Professional Makeup is the most popular special effects and stage makeup brand for profesionals and everyday consumers. In 2015, [they released a deep brown creme base shade](http://blackgirllonghair.com/2015/11/ben-nye-cosmetics-creates-minstrel-brown-color-makeup/) called “Minstrel Brown.” The names of the other shades coincided with fantasy characters (Witch Green, Vampire Pale, Ghoul Grey, etc.), but minstrelsy is abhorrent racist history, not fantasy. Ben Nye silently pulled the shade so now “Werewolf Brown” is [the only deep brown shade](https://camerareadycosmetics.com/products/ben-nye-creme-character-base?variant=22325414983), never releasing a statement about it.
