The following lists serve as a ledger of beauty brand behavior regarding **(content warning)** racism, anti-blackness, misogyny, homophobia, violent language, questionable practices, and religious and ethnic discrimination. Sources are linked within the text and images retain copyright to their respectful owners.

We consider the [first group](#avoid) of brands to be irredeemably blocklisted: brands and their owners who have proven their unforgivable stances on important topics. The brands in the [second group](#receipts) have exhibited less extreme or one-off instances of similar behavior. Our goal is to provide sourceable information so you can *make informed purchase decisions at your own discretion.*
