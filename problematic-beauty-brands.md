### Jeffree Star

#antiblack #misogynior

Ex scenester MySpace celebrity and Warped Tour musical artist, forever anti-black misogynist. His use of violent language toward PoC, WoC, and women et all date back to the mid-2000s.

CW for racist slurs and misogyny in the video and below screencap:

It took a while for him to address it, but he gave a half-hearted "I'm a human being and I fucked up" apology in summer 2016.

In March 2017, he used significantly deepened the complexion of a model for a product photoshoot. When he received criticism for using blackface to sell a product, he defended the ~ creative choices ~ of the shoot. You can use a trans woman of color as your model and still be anti-black, dickhead.

#antisemitic #didyoureallynameitthat

CW anti-semitism

Was engaged a complete shithead who collects Nazi memorabilia and [loves Trump](https://jezebel.com/trump-supporter-jesse-james-a-real-catch-calls-cheati-1793272829) without ever calling out his antisemitic behavior.

In 2013 & 2015, she drew attention for some stupid, though not racist naming of lipsticks, Celebutard and Underage Red. (She pulled Celebutard at Sephora‚Äôs behest and defended Underage Red.)

Kat‚Äôs not *completely* terrible ‚Äî she denounced Jeffree Star‚Äôs racist behavior in 2016 after excusing him for too long, and uninvited a contest winner to represent her brand once Kat found out the winner was a Trump supporter in 2017.

‚Ä¶But her accountability seems to be very, very shallow, focused on lifting white women instead of fighting anti-blackness.

### Lime Crime

#racism #antisemitism #culturalappropriation

Aside from repackaging formulas and being shitty to customers, founder Xenia Vorotova, who's been a fairly popular figure on the Internet even before Jeffree (LiveJournal and her blog predating the ‚ÄúMySpace whore‚Äù days) decided to dress up as Adolf Hitler for the lulz for Halloween (the same month Lime Crime launched).

Four years later in 2012, they released the China Doll eyeshadow palette‚Ä¶ ugh.

2015: A black-owned brand launched in 1994 for women of color, supported by black women, all of a sudden, 20 years later, claims it's not really for black women.

[This amazing reporting by Blaq Vixen Beauty](http://www.blaqvixenbeauty.com/black-beauty-brands-non-black-ceos/) shows there has always been sketchiness regarding who is credited as founding the company‚Ä¶ looks like hella erasure.

#antiblack #erasure

2015: It appears as though the black founder of the brand is being pushed out by a white man aaand Sephora deleted the Facebook comments instead of addressing any of it.

### Almay

#erasure #fuckwhitestandards

Drugstore mainstay brand Almay has *never* had deeper-than-beige shades for the skin and have thus never advertised for women of color. In 2016, they went so far as to call their white models (including country/American Idol star Carrie Underwood) "the American look" as "Simply American".

### Ben Nye

#antiblack #didyoureallynameitthat #silenceisviolence

In 2015 they released a deep brown creme base shade called ‚ÄùMinstrel brown.‚Äù The names of the other shades coincided with fantasy characters ("witch" green, "vampire" pale, "ghoul" grey). REALLY? They pulled the shade so now "Werewolf brown"  is the only deep brown and never released a statement about it.

### Illamasqua

#antiblack #badcampaign #doublingdown

Shortly after Trump‚Äôs inauguration in 2017, Illamasqua posted an [anti-fascist pledge](http://www.illamasqua.com/blog/illamasqua-anti-fascism-pledge/), which is nice, but doesn‚Äôt take back their doubling down on a campaign featuring blackface. It‚Äôd be one thing if they made the image (ugh) then said sorry and took it down forever, but they took it down and reposted it to defend themselves.

### Colourpop

#antiblack #didyoureallynameitthat #silenceisviolence

2016: Colourpop released highlight & contour sticks in a decent shade range, but the lightest shades got names like "Gummy Bear" and "Castle" while the deepest shades were "Yikes" and "Typo".

They quickly renamed the shades after the public calling out, but never issued a statement.

### Shea Moisture

Shea Moisture was a hair and skin staple brand for black women and women of color since its founding in 1991 ‚Äî the story of its inception from the founder's grandmother, a woman in Sierra Leone who started selling beauty products in the early 1900s is on its bottles.

After selling the brand to an investment firm co-founded by Mitt Romney, it began a slow and steady stream of re-formulization and advertising to and white white women and light-skinned WoC instead of kinky-coily-haired black  women who made the brand as successful as it got.

### Madam C.J. Walker

#antiblack

The brand was started by Madam C.J. Walker herself ‚Äî a black woman born in the late 1800s to slaves in Louisana, orphaned, widowed, and then built a new life for herself and her daughter by working in a barbershop and pairing up with other black women for experience, until she built her own company formulating and selling hair products, building a factory, salon, and school to support her business. Holy shit. The brand has since sold to the same parent company that reformulated Shea Moisture‚Ä¶ :( "all backgrounds and textures" ‚â† for black people, by black people

### Carol‚Äôs Daughter

#antiblack

2011 & 2014: The same story as SheaMoisture & Madam C.J. Walker stands here, too‚Ä¶ A company started by a black woman in her kitchen is sold to an investment company, then to L'oreal, and all of a sudden the messaging for black women is replaced with advertising toward "polyethnic" people.

The old fuck fourth-generation owner, before selling to LVMH, said some anti-black fuckass shit on broadcast tv and got fined a few grand for it. He was 75 at the time of the statement, in 2010, and worked for Guerlain through 2002.
