## Cruelty-free

### What is a cruelty-free brand?
Our definition of cruelty-free: **A cruelty-free brand is committed to never testing on animals in any part of their supply chain.** The brand does not test their products on animals. All ingredients are sourced from retailers who do not test on animals. Products may not be directly sold in countries that require animal testing by law.

### How is this determined?
A brand’s cruelty-free status is based on the databases by [Logical Harmony](http://logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-vegan-brand-list) + [Cruelty-Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/) and our own research contacting brands.

### Is vegan the same as cruelty-free?
Not necessarily! Vegan brands in the database have products with NO animal products or animal byproducts. A brand can be cruelty-free but not vegan, such as skincare (never tested on animals) made with ethically harvested honey.

### Where can I read more about this?
We love [Cruelty-Free Kitty’s 101 post on animal testing](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/the-revolution/) and [Logical Harmony’s FAQ](https://logicalharmony.net/faq/) regarding common questions about cruelty-free beauty brands.

## Affiliate links

### What are affiliate links?
When available, we use affiliate links to link to retailers and products. When you click or tap an affiliate link, you’ll be immediately redirected to the site. Using affiliate links allows us to make a small amount of money off your purchase when you click the link and make a purchase. If you’re uncomfortable with this, please feel free to search for the brand/product instead of clicking through the affiliate link.

### Why do you use them?
Compiling our list data takes a significant amount of time. Affiliate links are the least intrusive way to support our efforts while you support the entrepreneurs featured in our lists.

## Recommended products

### How do you choose the product featured for each brand?
We choose the featured product from each brand based on its rating, reviews, sales, or use. It’s often the brand’s flagship or most popular offering, but sometimes it’s just a product we find beautiful or innovative. Most products recommended to try are vegan and made without common irritants, but please look over the ingredients before purchasing!
