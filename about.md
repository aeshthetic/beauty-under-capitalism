## Cruelty-free?
Our definition of cruelty-free: **A cruelty-free brand is committed to never testing on animals in any part of their supply chain.** The brand does not test their products on animals. All ingredients are sourced from retailers who do not test on animals. Products may not be directly sold in countries that require animal testing by law.

### What about brands in the “More” section of each page?
If a brand isn’t cruelty-free but is woman of color majority-owned/founded, it’s listed in the “More” section _without_ a “cruelty-free” indicator.

If a brand is cruelty-free but isn’t majority-owned/founded by a woman of color, it’s listed in the “More” section _with_ a “cruelty-free” indicator.


### How is this determined?
A brand’s cruelty-free status is based on the databases by [Logical Harmony](http://logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-vegan-brand-list) + [Cruelty-Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/) and our own research contacting brands.

### Is vegan the same as cruelty-free?
Not necessarily! Vegan brands in the database have products with NO animal products or animal byproducts. A brand can be cruelty-free but not vegan, such as skincare (never tested on animals) made with ethically harvested honey.

### Where can I read more about this?
We love [Cruelty-Free Kitty’s 101 post on animal testing](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/the-revolution/) and [Logical Harmony’s FAQ](https://logicalharmony.net/faq/) regarding common questions about cruelty-free beauty brands.

## Recommended products

We choose the featured product from each brand based on its rating, reviews, sales, or use. It’s often the brand’s flagship or most popular product, but sometimes it’s just something we think is beautiful! Most products recommended to try are vegan and made without common irritants, but please look over the ingredients before purchasing!
