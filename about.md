## Beauty Under Capitalism

We know the health and beauty sector isn’t frivolous: it’s self-care, hygiene, artistry, and self-expression.

It’s important to see ourselves represented in the products we consume, from the brand’s daily social media posts to their CEO.

The massive popularity of the [BOMB (Black-Owned Makeup Brands) Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wUc3srYfPI) and viral success of [Fenty Beauty]() and [Pat McGrath]() finally forced the world to stop ignoring how important women of color consumers are to the beauty industry.

Feel confident in your beauty regimen knowing your purchases support businesses owned by Black, Latinx, Middle Eastern & North African, and Asian CEOs of marginalized genders.

Vote with your wallet. Make informed purchases.

Your haircare, skincare, and makeup desires can be met without feeling consumerist guilt in our inescapable capitalist society. There is beauty in it when you give your money to women of color. _Beauty Under Capitalism_.
