title: "MENA women owned cruelty-free beauty brands"

The cruelty-free status of these brands is based on the [Logical Harmony database](logicalharmony.net/cruelty-free-vegan-brand-list) and my own research. Most products recommended to try are vegan (or otherwise explicitly noted) and made without known irritants, but please look over the ingredients before purchasing!
